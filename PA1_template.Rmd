# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1



## Loading and preprocessing the data

We load the data and display the structure of the object.

```{r}
data <- read.table("activity.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
str(data)
```

We convert the date variable to date type.

```{r}
data <- transform(data, date = as.Date(date))
str(data)
```

We display the first lines of the object.

```{r}
head(data)
```
